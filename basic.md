## Typescript           
* Typescript is an open source language developed and maintained by the microsoft
* Typescript is the superset of the javascript
* Adding new features and advantages to javascript
* Browsers cant execute the typescript
* Typescript code compiled to javascript code
* TypeScript is a programming language but also it is a tool.
* TypeScript helps to prevent some errors during development
### Key Difference:
There are one key different between TypeScript and JavaScript is
* JavaScript uses ‘dynamic type’(resolved at runtime)
* TypeScript uses ‘static type’(set during development).
### CORE TYPES:
Typescript enables us to write our own types which javascript already knows and ts all the supports.
One of the core type we work with bot ts and js is Number.
### NUMBER:
* There is no special type for integers,floats ,numbers with or without decimal are all considered as Number type.
* Other programming languages have special integer type,float type but both js and ts doesn’t have it. 
### STRING:
* String datatype that would be a text with the 'Hi',"Hi",`Hi`
* Strings are simply a text and javascript knows about the string value types
### BOOLEAN:
* Boolean datatype is an true,false working with if statements just these two,no "truthy" or "falsy"
values.
## Type of Inference:
TypeScript knows the JavaScript language and  it will generate types for you in many cases.
For example: in creating a variable and assigning it to a particular value, TypeScript will use the value as its type.
```javascript
let helloworld="hello world"
    let helloworld:string
```
* TypeScript knows that helloWorld is a string
* TypeScript can build a type-system that accepts JavaScript code but has types. 
# OBJECT
* The fundamental way that we group and pass around data is through objects. In TypeScript, we represent those through object types
```js
function greet(person: { name: string; age: number }) {
  return "Hello " + person.name;
}
```
## ARRAY TYPE
* A TypeScript array is an ordered list of data. To declare an array that holds values of a specific type, we use syntax:
ts
let skill = skills[0];
console.log(typeof(skill));

Array properties and methods
* TypeScript arrays can access the properties and methods of a JavaScript. For example,  the length property to get the number of element in an array
```js
let series = [1, 2, 3];
console.log(series.length); // 3
```
## Tuples
* Array consists of values of homogeneous (same) types but sometimes when we need to store a collection of a different types values in a single variable, then we will go with Tuples.
```js
Syntax:
let tuple_name = [val1, val2, val3, ...val n];  
```
Example:
```
let arrTuple = [501, "welcome", 505, "Mohan"];  
console.log(arrTuple);
```
## Enums
* Enums are one of the few features TypeScript has which is not a type-level extension of JavaScript.
* Enums allow a developer to define a set of named constants. 
* Using enums can make it easier to document intent, or create a set of distinct cases. TypeScript provides both numeric and string-based enums.
Numeric enum
```js
enum Direction {
  Up = 1,
  Down,
  Left,
  Right,
}
```
String enum
* In a string enum, each member has to be constant-initialized with a string literal, or with another string enum member.
ts
enum Direction {
  Up = "UP",
  Down = "DOWN",
  Left = "LEFT",
  Right = "RIGHT",
}
### The any Type:
TypeScript any type allows you to store a value of any type.
##### Why we use any  in TypeScript:
Special type any is used to tell TypeScript that a variable can be of any type.
### Union Type:
* Typescript a union type variable is a variable in which can store multiple type of values(i.e. number,string etc)
* Variables are defined using the pipe ( '|' ) symbol between the types. 
```js
let myVar: string | number; //myVar can store string and number types
```
### Literal Types:
There are three sets of literal types available in TypeScript today
* strings 
* numbers
* booleans
By using literal types you can allow an exact value which a string, number, or boolean must have.
### Literal Narrowing:
When you declare a variable via var or let, you are telling the compiler that there is the chance that this variable will change its contents.
### String Literal Types:
In practice string literal types combine nicely with union types, type guards, and type aliases.
### Numeric Literal Types:
TypeScript also has numeric literal types, which act the same as the string literals
### Boolean Literal Types:
Typescript also has boolean literal types you might use these to constrain object values whose properties ar interrelated.
### Function Type and call backs:
A callback function is defined as a function passed into another function as an argument
